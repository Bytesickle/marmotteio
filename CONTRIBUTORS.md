# Contributors

We want to express our deepest gratitude to everyone who has contributed to this project. Your effort and commitment play a crucial role in the success and vitality of this open-source project.

**Why Open Source Matters**

Open source projects are about more than just freely available code. They represent a collaborative, transparent, and community-driven approach to creating software.

Everyone, regardless of their skill level, can contribute to open source projects, and it is this collective intellect and effort that drives innovation and progress in the field of technology.

Moreover, open source projects give users the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software for any purpose they wish. This freedom is not just about cost savingsâ€”it's about user independence, transparency, and the right to control one's own digital experience.

Through the contributions of individual developers and users around the world, open source projects like ours thrive. We're excited to see this project grow and evolve with your help.
